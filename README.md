# OFDM-research
some basics about OFDM communication. Contain VHDL, matlab ( mainly matlab actually...), and some LABVIEW files for the hardware 

the .m files are linked with MATLAB :
  It ( ofdm_main.m) simulates an OFDM transmission throughout a medium modelled with several parameters ( clipping noise, Gaussian noise,   etc...)
  Basically, you must put all the six .m files in your MATLAB working directory and call 'main_OFDM.m' in the MATLAB command prompt.
  Then, you've to pick an image (for example, those in my repository. This image MUST be a .bmp file, otherwise it'll just re-asking you     for a .bmp file) and enter some parameters ( SNR, IFFT size, etc...) 
  
  Then, wait for the output file ! ( ... and all the plots coming with it ! ==> useful for deeper investigations)
  
  Well done, you have simulated an OFDM transmission for a .bmp file !
